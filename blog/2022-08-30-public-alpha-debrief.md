Thanks to everybody that took part in the Public Alpha.

We got lots of actionable feedback, and have been busy working on new features ready for mainnet - we'll have some news on that soon.

Some high-level numbers, for the curious:

- 1,061 users took part in the challenges
- 6/11 ended up being claimed or completed
- 20,500 $HOWL in rewards were claimed

Since then, we've been getting ready for some final testing and kicking the tyres on the final application.

We're super stoked to share what we've been working on with you all!
